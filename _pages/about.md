<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D student of computer science at the College of Computer Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, advised by Prof. [Kaijun Ren (任开军)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kaijun-Ren). I am now woring on AI for Earth. For example, deep learning-based data assimilation, and weather forecasting big models.

I won the Lei Jun Scholarship (雷军奖学金) of Wuhan Univerisity (School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Class of 2016, Top 1) in 2019.

My research interests include spatial-temporal forecasting, data assimilation, fundation mode, l and deep learning. I have published 6 papers in top journals and conferences with total 11 citations.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
